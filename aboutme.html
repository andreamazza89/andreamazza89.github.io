<p>Hi, my name is Andrea Mazzarella. Originally Italian, currently living in London and on the road to software crafts(person)ship.</p>
<p>I have started this blog to document my experience at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">MakersAcademy</a> and hopefully will carry on blogging - mainly about coding, but also food, travelling and happy living.</p>
<p>I am addicted to learning, continuous improvement and feedback (which is a big shortcut to continuous improvement)</p>
<p>This below is a little picture of my face so you can put a name to a face!</p>
