<p>Hi, my name is Andrea Mazzarella. Originally Italian, currently living in London and on the road to software crafts(person)ship.</p>
<p>Having graduated from <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">MakersAcademy</a> in mid-August '16, I am now a resident apprentice at awesome <a href="http://www.8thLight.com">8thLight</a> </p>
<p>I am addicted to learning, continuous improvement and feedback (which is a big shortcut to continuous improvement)</p>
<p>This below is a little picture of my face so you can put a name to a face!</p>
