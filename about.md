Hi, my name is Andrea Mazzarella. Originally Italian, currently living in London and on the road to software crafts(person)ship.

I have started this blog to document my experience at MakersAcademy and hopefully will carry on blogging â€“ mainly about coding, but also food, travelling and happy living.

I am addicted to learning, continuous improvement and feedback (which is a big shortcut to continuous improvement)

This below is a little picture of my face so you can put a name to a face!
