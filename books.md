As part of the apprenticeship, but also because learning new things is great, I am
going to keep reading programming-related books. A list follows.

Having read a few technical books before, I want to find a more effective way to
retain the contents of each book. In order to do so, I am going to write notes 
for each chapter I read. This will make the reading slower but hopefully more 
meaningful. The links below are to my notes. Please feel free to contribute :)
