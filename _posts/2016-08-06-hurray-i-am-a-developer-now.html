<p>Yesterday it was graduation day at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a>, and all project groups presented their product in front of a large crowd attending the event.</p>
<p>Our project was called SMRT mirror, and you can check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYk-d6q4iWI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>; in short, we put together an application that enables a mirror to display useful information such as weather, time, transport information, news feeds, etc. Uh and you can control the mirror with hand gestures!! We are very proud of it and everyone loved the demo; we are considering entering a competition and expanding the product with more functionality.</p>
<p>So, am I a developer now? Am I done learning and just need to look for a job? Absolutely not. I mean, I am developer of course but I will never be done learning, and you know what? That is one of the reasons I love this. Learning new things and growing knowledge is fantastic, and I do not want to ever be 'done' learning, continually improving as a developer and a person every day.</p>
<p>Next week is Hiring week: we will be working on our curricula, doing a practice tech test (a coding challenge sent to you as part of the interview process) and meeting a few companies that will pitch their job openings.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to start looking for a job and getting a feel for how we fare in the real world. I also look forward to spending some time on my own schedule, studying and working on all of the things I find interesting and want to improve on. Fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
