Day two of the pairing project. Today we opened a pull request, hurray!!

I have come to really like being in the newbie zone. I am not sure if that is an
expression, but what I mean is the 'place' in which you are starting to learn
something new and you know very little about it. It can feel overwhelming, but the
nice thing is that the only way is up and you can tangibly see your progress. It
makes me think of this blog post: [Itâ€™s Good to Suck](https://medium.com/@dailyzen/it-s-good-to-suck-685570c894a1#.jf4ihn6lq).

This applies to anything we can learn, be that cycling, snowboarding, playing
an instrument, a language, pottery, you name it. The great thing about technology
is that it moves so fast and it is so huge a field that you could spend a lifetime learning.
I like that, and I would like to think that I will always keep learning new things
as part of what I do daily.
