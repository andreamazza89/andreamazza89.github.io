<p>Another week at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">makers</a>, this is still amazing, and if I look back at the first day, it feels like months ago, but it was actually less than two weeks ago. So much can be learned and done in a day, and there is even some time for table tennis! I also had the chance to know a lot of my peers better, as well as some people from the upper cohort /graduates. All of which are awesome and interesting people.<br />
One of the things I am very happy to have learned this week (or at least started to learn..) is that I need/want to make myself as humble as I can and listen to what other people have to say. Of course I still contribute with my own ideas, but listening and trying to understand what other people have to say is a goldmine of ideas and fresh approaches to any problem.<br />
This is what happened: in more than one occasion, I found myself discussing a certain topic with others and only being interested in letting them know my thoughts, which is very arrogant and assumes that I always know better. I would let them speak out of courtesy, but I was not really listening and just waiting for my turn to dish out the 'truth'. As soon as I noticed this behaviour, I told myself off, made myself humble again, and started to really listen to what they had to say, which means I am learning more and faster, and at the same time I am contributing to their learning. For instance, this week my pairing partner and I started sketching all the classes in a program on a whiteboard, and the more people gathered around us to contribute, the better the design got. The contributions would not come from one person only, but from different people, who each brought their own approach and knowledge to the problem. In short, a community of brains is a lot better than one brain. Wonderful thing is it not? I took a picture of the board at some point, here it is!</p>

<p>Last week I wrote about <a href="https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/this-is-incredible-makers-week-1/" target="_blank">Behaviour Driven Development</a>, which is software development that focuses on the user interaction with the product first before worrying about the underlying software architecture. As I am reading about the subject, there is a really interesting point made in 'The RSpec Book' written by David Chelimsky that I would like to share. The book talks about how traditional software can fail due to excessive design from the beginning of the project. It explains: the main problem is that software is being designed like buildings, where it gets expensive to get anything wrong (think about having to take down and rebuild a wall). Because of this, the specification of the final product has to be very accurate and detailed from the outset, so that no mistakes are made; the main problem is that the end user -the client- does not fully know what they want until the building starts taking shape and then they change their minds about what it is that they really wanted. This is natural but can be costly, which is why a buildings' design has to be very strict and detailed. However, the only cost in software is people's time. Spending too much time upfront trying to pin down something that not even the end-user knows can be wasteful. Instead, a Behaviour Driven Development approach recommends starting from a small client requirement and grow the project organically by releasing a finished product very early so the client can figure out what it is they really wanted and let the production team know. This might happen a few times, with each iteration helping the client and team shape the final product. In other words, the design is allowed to evolve rather than be written in stone at the beginning. A benefit of this is that new features and changes to existing ones are much easier to implement. Pretty cool idea I say!</p>
<p>Ok, that is it, now onto writing a take-away system for the weekend challenge!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
