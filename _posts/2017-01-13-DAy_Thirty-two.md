Ode to [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/).

I still cannot believe how great it is to be working for this company. I am
currently going through their apprenticeship, a period of roughly six months in
which the only worry is to learn as much as you can and grow as a developer and
consultant. Awesome right? Each apprentice is assigned two mentors, who are
effectively the apprentice's client, driving the learning experience with
requirements, feedback and insightful conversations, with huge flexibility on what
the apprentice is working on, to suit the learning experience to the individual.

And it does not end here. Everyone in the company is big on continual learning,
knowledge-sharing and self-improvement. It is not just about getting things done
but doing the best we can to deliver constant value and building the best software
we can. Incidentally, everyone is also super nice. Going to work has never felt
this good.

Learning culture is not just a claim to sound like a good company on paper:
every Friday afternoon everyone gathers at the office to spend time learning;
no client work is done on Friday afternoons. Workshops, pairing, talks, interesting
conversations create a great environment to explore new technologies, learn about
existing ones and share knowledge. Yesterday for example one of the crafters ran
a session on data structures, during which we implemented a linked list in C. It
was so much fun!

Thank you [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/)!
