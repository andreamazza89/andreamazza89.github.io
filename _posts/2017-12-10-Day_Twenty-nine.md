- Learning Java is not just about the language, but also tools and conventions.

Today I carried on learning Java, finished writing a FizzBuzz kata and then spent
the rest of the day having my IPM (iteration planning meeting) and writing the Roman
numerals kata in Java.

When I started learning Elixir -at the beginning of the apprenticeship- I knew
it was going to be about a different paradigm (functional programming) and
program design, but with Java it is different: I am not just trying to get better
at Object Oriented programming, but also getting to grips with IntelliJ as well
as Java conventions. So, how do I make sure I am as effective as possible with my
learning? There are three clear areas to work on: program design, Java conventions and
intelliJ. There is no doubt that these three conflict with each other:
trying to figure out how to copy/paste in the middle of writing a method makes
you less effective at writing an algorithm. Because of this, it is tempting to
focus on each element in isolation; for example, I could try to become an
IntelliJ guru by reading through their user guides and staring at a list of
shortcuts for hours!

However I do not think working on these elements in isolation would be useful:
I find I remember a certain shortcut or technique much better if I find out about
it because I need it in the middle of a project rather than as part of a long
list of shortcuts, out of context. This is similar to how I first started learning
the English language: our teacher would have us read simple stories and figure
out any new words ourselves; this way we would actually remember the new word as
associated to a context and we had to actually figure out what it meant. Compare
this with just trying to memorise a list of words with their translation next to it:
you might be able to force these into your brain for some time and memorise them,
but only to eventually forget about them.

Ciao.
