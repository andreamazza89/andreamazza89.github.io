<p>Another weekday post; I did not write anything over the weekend and it turns out I miss writing a post plusÂ it is quite nice to sit down and reflect on how this (the course) is all going.<br />
This is a first: I am frustrated and worried. It is not Makers' fault, it is probably mine, or maybe nobody's.</p>
<p>The problem is, we have dived into new technologies and are trying to learn them very fast. Too fast I feel. I like a deep understanding of my tools rather than making something work and not understand why. However time constraints sometimes mean we cannot have a full understanding of everything.</p>
<p>This week we have been divided into small groups of four to write a simple app that mimics the airBnB service. We were told we could do that with the language/frameworks we have just learned, or use different ones. With my group, we chose to opt for the latter, and boy is it a struggle.<br />
Having not much experience building full-stack apps, we are trying to make another one with an unfamiliar language, framework, database, testing framework....</p>
<p>The main reason for frustration is that I find myself often running in circles, starting something -be that an article, exercise, tutorial- and then interrupt and switch to something new as there is so much too learn and I do not want to take too long on any single thing. But at the same time I do want to take too long on everything, so I can be confident with my understanding of it; but there just is not enough time!</p>
<p>On top of that, it really does not feel like we are making any progress with our project, as the setup phase seems to have no end, and we are yet to write one line of code 1.5 days in...</p>
<p>So what is the solution? I am really not sure. First, accept that this is not the end of the world and always try to make the best out of it. Also, do not give up. Also, I think I need to make sure I stick to learning one thing at a time, and properly. It is difficult to stay focused and stick to one learning resource or exercise but I need to make sure I am not jumping between resources and not learning anything.</p>
<p>I also need to learn to take breaks to relax the mind and so I can spend more time with Liz. Yesterday evening I went for a walk in the park with her after dinner and it was great.</p>
<p>Finally one thought: being in this with others that are having the same or similar problems does help and makes everything better.</p>
