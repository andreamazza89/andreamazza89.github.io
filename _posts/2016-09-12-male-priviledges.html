<h5>Disclaimer: the contents of this post should be no news to most people, and that is a good thing. If however someone's eyes are opened as a result of reading this, then I would be very happy with the outcome. I feel unqualified to discuss the topics below, but I would rather raise awareness with incomplete information than keep silent.</h5>
<p>Hopefully you agree that in an ideal world every human being should be treated equally and have access to similar opportunities in life, regardless of where they are from, which family (or non-family) they were born in, what they believe in, the colour of their skin, physical or mental disabilities, their gender and sex. If you disagree, then please let me know why. I like to keep an open mind on anything, however I feel it is going to be hard to move my position on this one.</p>
<p>If you are a white heterosexual, middle class male, then you are seriously at risk of not realising how unfair the job market is against anyone but your specific category. I certainly was oblivious until a few years ago. In a way, it is 'normal': when everything goes well, it is hard to realise we are privileged and society is geared towards favouring us. I am extremely thankful to have met my partner, Liz, who not only is an amazing individual, but also opened my eyes towards equality at work, and keeps doing so.</p>
<p>Ok, now go take a look at this <a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/programs/dsj/files/pdfs/dsjguide-male-privilege.pdf" target="_blank">list of male privileges in the workplace</a>. Please take some time to go through all of them. If you only remember one of the points, I would make it number 46:</p>
<blockquote><p>46. I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, being aware of the issue is a good start, but should not be the end of it. I think we should make it our duty to try and close the gap. If you do not know where to start, have a look at this <a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/feminism-men-practical-steps" target="_blank">list of things men can do to support feminism</a>.</p>
<p>I often volunteer as a coach at <a href="http://www.codebar.io/" target="_blank">codebar</a>, where underrepresented groups are given free coaching and support to learn programming.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post managed to raise some awareness on the topic. If it even changes just one person's perspective, then I am happy.  If you disagree with anything above, please let me know.</p>
<p>Finally, the King of Norway recently made an amazing speech that promotes equality and celebrates diversity. Worth a watch, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/king-of-norway-delivers-emotionally-charged-speech-in-favour-of-lgbt-rights-and-refugees-a7226216.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
