<p>(Disclaimer: there are a few paragraphs that are not strictly about coding. If you want to cut to the chase, start from right after the picture with food on it!)</p>
<p>It has now almost been 3 weeks since the precourse at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank">Makers</a> started and I am in bliss. It is a fantastic mixture of gorging on new information, self-improvement, moments of frustration followed by insta-satisfaction when solving a problem, and constant discovery...sounds good? It sure does to me. Time is flying and it seems there are not enough hours in a day to learn as much as we need to with the course.</p>
<p>Anyway, brace yourself, my little brag moment is coming.</p>
<p>I have spent this week back at my home town, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/62018+Potenza+Picena+Province+of+Macerata,+Italy/@43.3663303,13.6142642,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x133276bae12f998f:0x11a0fa77beaa7ec!8m2!3d43.367398!4d13.6234038" target="_blank">Potenza Picena</a>, in Italy. It is a tiny village at the top of a hill and very, very close to the Adriatic sea. See below a picture of my office this week ;)<br />

Isn't it awesome?? I have been going to the beach every morning and studied the day away with the sound of the sea splashing away in the background. One day I hope to spend some of my time working from here (or somewhere similar). I have also heavily indulged in the local cuisine; fish is my favourite thing. Below is a picture with a selection of the things I ate.<br />

<p>Delicious. Ok, now onto serious business and, incidentally, the reason for this post's title; the importance of bringing a compass.<br />
The more I go on with the course and coding in general, the more I realise how important it is to have a compass for most, if not all, things.<br />
What I mean by compass is a tool (or tools) to keep track of where you are and where you are going, without deviations. Ooops, that is the definition of a compass, so let be more specific and tell you about my compass.<br />
In writing this post, I am using two tools: the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">pomodoro technique</a> and a bunch of bullet points on what I want to write about and in which order. The pomodoro technique helps with focusing on one task at a time, with frequent short breaks to keep the mind sharp and one simple rule: if any distraction arises, write it down and deal with it later.<br />
This is even more important in programming, especially for a novice developer like me. It is tempting to jump onto the keyboard as soon as I am given a problem to solve, trying to make it work with a specific method I have in mind, but no clear picture of what I am really doing and where I am going! Twenty minutes later, either the code is messy, or I get frustrated and realise I should have stepped back, thought about the problem and made a plan. Doing this in the first place saves time and it is quite nice to have a plan. I talked about this in a <a href="https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/07/pre-course-week-2-officially-unemployed/" target="_blank">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>In other news, this week I broke my laptop. I mysteriously find that cool and funny. What happened is I somehow created a shortcut to the root folder into one of my repositories and then wiped my laptop trying to get rid of it (idiot!). The reason why I am so relaxed about this is that all of my data is up in the cloud, so 4 hours later I had the Operating System reinstalled, along with all the tools I need and as if nothing had happened :) One major thing to learn here: do not try to delete all contents of the root folder and mindlessly answer 'yes' when the computer gives you a chance to redeem yourself!</p>
<p>Finally, I am trying to become a Vim ninja. Vim is a text editor, like Word is, however there is no mouse nor pretty tabs and buttons in Vim: everything is done from the comfort of the keyboard and it is as dry as it gets. Sounds awful I hear you say? Well it is, at least to start with, but stick with it and you will move through a text file like wind and perform any sort of edits at the speed of light. It also means that no matter what machine you are using, there are strong chances that you will be able to use Vim. I am Vimming everything, even this post (see photographic proof below). I am also working<br />
on my typing skills, using this nice <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
