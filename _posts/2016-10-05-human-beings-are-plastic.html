<p>I love how humans can -through sheer practice and perseverance- become experts at anything. This is perhaps not universally true, but has a number of applications. I especially like it when progress can easily be demonstrated.</p>
<p>For instance, a few years ago, my friend and I decided to pick up skateboarding. Initially we could not even stand on the damn thing, but after a few days we could balance ourselves, and started learning to steer. We were practicing almost everyday and could clearly see improvement, until we hit the first big hurdle: the ollie. An ollie is the most basic trick there is. In short, it is jumping an obstacle. Now, jumping while you are on the board is one thing, but how do you lift the bloody thing up with your feet!?!? It seems to defy all laws of physics, but it is possible, and there there are many videos online that explain how to do it. And guess what, after a few weeks of deliberate practice and perseverance, we both managed to ollie! How rewarding!!</p>
<p>Notice how another amazing thing is that the Internet empowers us to share or find resources on how to learn something (sorry for the boring obvious statements).</p>
<p>Now the above might not apply to all of the things we want to learn, as some are much more complex and involve more than just muscle memory, but there are so many that do fit and we could easily learn/improve if we had clear goals and were consistent.</p>
<p>For example, before I started coding, I could not touch-type. I realised if I was going to spend the rest of my life typing code, I should probably get better at typing. Since then, I have spent about 15 minutes a day practicing touch-typing on <a href="https://www.typingclub.com" target="_blank">this site</a> and can now see huge improvement, which is very useful and satisfying. And it 'only' takes 15 minutes a day. How easy is that?? The key is consistency; a few minutes a day for a couple of months make a serious difference.</p>
<p>So think about your daily schedule, how easy would it be to set aside an hour to practice a few things that you want to get better at? If you make it a habit, you will be getting better and better at whatever you pick and once you are pro at it, pick a new thing.</p>
<p>Dedication and will power are key:  I am sure we all can squeeze an hour somewhere every day, but it is much easier to be lazy and not do it.</p>
<p>So what are you going to master in your practice hour? Make it public and track your progress, you will be amazed.</p>
<p>PS: it works better if you do it at the same time every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve reading speed (currently roughly 180 words per minute), maintaining or improving comprehension. 20 min</li>
<li>Keep improving fast typing. 10 min</li>
<li>Exercise. Go for a run or a swim or anything that keeps me fit. 30 min</li>
<li>(maybe alternate playing the keyboard with exercise?)</li>
</ul>
