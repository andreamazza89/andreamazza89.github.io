<p>This week at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">makers</a> was pretty ace! In anticipation of final project (next week and the one after), this week we did a mini-project, or as they call, it a Makerthon.<br />
On Monday, people pitched their ideas, which were then voted and a shortlist was made. We then assembled into teams of 4-6, more or less based on our first choice of project.</p>
<p>I was in awesome BattleCodes team, and <a href="https://battlecodes.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">this</a> is what we made (please let me know if you find any bugs). Battlecodes allows two programmers to race each other in solving a coding challenge. You connect, pick a challenge (which creates a room), share your room code with your friend and start racing. The game ends when one of the two players submits code that passes all tests. Cool right?</p>
<p>It was amazing for me as I learnt about a new technology, websockets, which enables real-time web applications. We also designed and built our own mini-micro-tiny frontend testing framework, which we are pretty proud of. This is the 'engine' that evaluates the user's submitted solution against a set of expectations and publishes test results to both the user (in visual form) and the server (as raw data). If the test results are positive, the server knows to end the game and announce the winner. Coooool!</p>
<p>It is marvellous to see how much can be achieved in a few days; it is also amazing to see how well a team self-organises if all the members are motivated. We had zero input from Makers and did produce our own schedule, task assignments, pair rotations, product specification, etc. In other words, self management is a powerful thing, especially as this enables everyone in the team to feel a sense of ownership over the project. When you want to work instead of having to work, you are happy :)</p>
<p>We enjoyed doing this so much that there have been talks of expanding and improving the product for fun after Makers!</p>
<p>So, as mentioned, next week the two-weeks final project begins. Exciting! Yesterday we had another round of pitching for projects; the shortlist was then announced and we each expressed our top-three preferences. I really hope I get to work in my top-choice, which is a 'smart mirror'. In short, this is a mirror with a screen behind it that is only visible when on. It can be (once we build it) customised to show many different widgets, such as custom weather, local traffic info, latest news, go wild! We might also add speakers to it, so that it can be programmed to, say, wake you up with your favourite song or radio station. Mood lighting do I hear you say? Sure, we can add an arduino to it, maybe it lights up and changes colours with music, or perhaps it gradually turns on and moves to full brightness to help you wake up. And calendar? Of course, sync up your calendar and today's schedule will be shown. Picture frame? why not, maybe as a screen-saver kind of thing.</p>
<p>I could go on for a while, so I will stop now. My fingers are crossed and hopefully I will be working on this project as of Monday.</p>
<p>Now back to do some coding! No weekend assignmentÂ this week as they told us to take a break but taking a break from coding sounds more like a punishment than anything else to me right now ;)</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
