<p>Oh my, week 8 of <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a> has already finished and the end of the course is approaching fast!<br />
It is still great fun and we are absorbing knowledge like big sponges in a big puddle (I know, awesome analogy right?).</p>
<p>This week I ran another workshop for our 'juniors', which was a lot of fun; I really liked how some of them carried on working on the exercise I gave them and then sent me a solution later on during the day. I love people who care.<br />
I am trying to link these presentation I prepare with a common theme: simplicity. Simplicity is -I find- most important when approaching something as vast and complicated as programming (sorry for being a bit vague). Our heads (well, mine for sure) struggle to hold intricate designs and concepts at once and if there is anything we can do to make any task or any reasoning simpler and more pragmatic, then we should.<br />
In his great book 'The Software Craftsman', Sandro Mancuso describes how in one of his first jobs he was told off for writing some code that was too complex and hard to understand: everyone should strive for the simplest and most readable code they can, so that others will not struggle understanding it. Writing simple code might not be simple, but is fundamental.<br />
Last week's presentation was on using diagrams as a tool to help understand system design and interaction between classes in object oriented programming. Diagramming in general is a fantastic tool to help simplify our thoughts and solidify our understading of a system or process.<br />
This week I talked about the four-phase-test pattern, which helps break down our reasoning when writing a test for a certain behaviour in the application under the lens. All the presentations I made are available <a href="https://github.com/andreamazza89/presentations" target="_blank">here</a> and I would be more than happy to discuss or give them again, just reach out to me :)</p>
<p>Ok, now onto what I learned this week and the reason for the title.<br />
In computer science (am I allowed to say that or am I just a programmer??) there is a fantastic concept called 'information hiding'. Due to the amount of complexity behind 'computer' systems, it is fundamental to hide certain aspects away in order to focus on a specific element. In other words, there is no need to understand the full extent of a system in order to operate on one part of it, as long as the system is nicely modular. Here is an example: the driver of a car does not necessarily need to understand how the engine and transmission systems work, they can just accept that engine/transmission somehow respond to our actions and move the car, based on a set of conventions, being the pedals, steering wheel, etc. So, moving back to computers and anything that can be programmed, as a programmer I do not have to deeply understand the inner workings of the processor and logic units in order to write useful programs; I can just see these as 'black boxes' and trust them to do what I expect them to. This concept also works within a program: I or someone else might work on a specific module for a long time to make it do something useful, but once we are done building it, the users of that module do not need to know about hot that module works, they just understand what it does and how to make it do the things it does. MAGIC.<br />
This week we have started learning Ruby on Rails, which is a web framework that allows you to build a web application super-fast. Learning Ruby on Rails heavily requires trusting the 'black box' I refer to above: the high complexity of what the framework does is hidden behind the simple and familiar-sounding keywords that Rails gives us to build the system. This week I have more than once had to stop myself from trying to understand how Rails does something and just trust the magic; this is information hiding at its best!<br />
So again, simplicity is paramount. Turns out simplicity is one of the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html" target="_blank">extreme programming </a>values...What a coincidence!</p>
<p>Right I am going back to work now; this weekend I am building an Instagram clone using Rails.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
