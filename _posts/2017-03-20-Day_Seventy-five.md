Second week of the apprentices project.
Today we had our first Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) with our clients (some of
the crafters), where we discussed our process so far, including demonstrations of
new features and also went over future tasks.

One thing I would like to get better at is having a broader view of issues, which
should help estimate what a task entails more effectively. I think a slight change
of attitude is required: I need to consider the task within the wider scope of the
existing application and try to think of as many things that could go wrong as
possible.
That was vague enough; let me try with an example. Let's say the client wants to
add a red button to refresh form content within a specific page. My immediate
reaction would be to think of how to achieve this and if it sounds possible maybe
look around the code and convince myself that we can indeed add the red button.

But I should not stop there; I should think about all the things that could go
wrong. After all, this is my job: the Client comes up with requirements and they
rely on us to implement them and inform them about any complications.
So, as well as thinking about how I would add the red button to the page and
make an ajax call to refresh form content, I should think about any impact this
might have on the rest of the application, also how this could be misused, what if
the user refreshes the page from the browser, and is there any other similar form
that will require the same button?

I would like these questions to become second nature: when looking at any task,
I should not only worry about how to implement it, but also about the implications
it has on the wider scope of the application and think about the not-so-happy paths.

I have a feeling experience is key here, but the right mindset will help too.
