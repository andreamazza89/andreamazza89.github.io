### Pills
- Goodbye Elixir!
- Hello Java.

Today was my last day of Elixir.

It has been a great ride, I really enjoyed learning this language, as well as
getting a taste of functional programming. I published my own Hex package for
the core tictactoe library, which can be found [here!](https://hex.pm/packages/elixir_tictactoe).
And then used it as a dependency in my [web version](https://github.com/andreamazza89/elixir_web_ttt)
of the game; how cool!

Now a new chapter starts, as I am going to spend some time learning Java. I have
tinkered a little bit with this language before I even started Makers Academy, when
programming used to be one of my hobbies...I am curious to see how much of it
I still remember: at the time I did not even know what a test was!

I started this afternoon: installed IntelliJ and Java. Having only ever used Vim,
this process felt quite overwhelming, as it seems as though there is a lot of
overhead involved, both in the language and the tool. At the end of the day I had
a million browser pages open as I kept having to ask Google what something meant,
or how to do something in IntelliJ. I am also incredibly slow as I try to find my way
around the editor. This is good, and exciting, as I am starting from scratch and
have heaps to learn. Nice!

Ciao.
