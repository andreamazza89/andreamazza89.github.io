### Pills
- Fun pairing with crafters!
- Idiomatic Java.

This morning I joined Jarkyn and Rabea to look at what they were working on.
This was really fun, as I was given a chance to try understand what the part of
the application they were dealing with in (relative) depth. The functionality they
were adding is single-sign-out, which consists in an automatic sign out triggered
by another application that is part of one single-sign-in/single-sign-out
domain. I questioned how exactly the process worked and we went in depth to
understand the full cycle. It was really fun, and I hope I did not slow them down
too much!

Later on I had an Iteration Planning Meeting with my mentors. The biggest takeaway
is that I should try to find Java conventions and follow them as much as possible.
A convention is not intrinsically good just because it is a convention, but the
fact that it became one is a strong indication that there are good reasons for it
to exist. I still do not want to blindly adopt conventions, but I should look for
them, understand why they make sense and then adopt them. Adopting conventions
also ensures that the code I write is not surprising, which is good, as I want
my code to be as unsurprising as it can be.
