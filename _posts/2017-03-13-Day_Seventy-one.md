Today I started working on a project with other apprentices. A pairing kind of
project you say? Exactly, a pairing project with pairing programmers programming
in pairs.

What is exciting about this one, is the fact that it is not greenfield, which is
a first for me. The challenge and skill set is different: rather than worrying
about the design we are putting together and making sure we are not prematurely
optimising, we are trying to familiarise ourselves with the codebase as quickly
as possible to start making modifications to it.

I find exploring a (relatively) large codebase difficult and want to get better
at it; perhaps I should challenge myself to explore a new codebase every week to
get faster at getting to grips with large systems. Open source contributions might
be the answer...

I found scanning through the project similar to learning something new in WikiPedia:
as you read through an entry you realise that there are other things you need to
understand, so you click through the links, start learning about the other things,
then maybe find yet more links to concepts you need to know, open a billion tabs...
The path down the rabbit hole is very long and treacherous!
We cannot know everything, so the art to master here is to understand what we need
to know and what we can ignore or have a shallow understanding of, without getting sidetracked.
Turns out it was easy for me to fail at both: I would feel the need to understand everything
and I would easily get sidetracked into trying to figure out how something worked,
even though it was irrelevant to what we were doing.

Pairing over this stage of the project added an extra challenge: not only are we
all trying to get to grips with the new technologies, codebase, etc..., but also
our heads work differently (which is great :) ), so that it is hard to stay on
track. Our approach is to tackle the first story right away and only understand
what we need for this story. I feel this is better than trying to get to
grips with the whole system.

Looking forward to the second day on this project.
