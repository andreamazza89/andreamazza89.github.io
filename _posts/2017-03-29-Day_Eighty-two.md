This is the last week I will spend on the apprentices paring project. We are working
on adding new features/tackling bugs on an existing internal application.

A couple of thoughts from today, one to do with estimating, the other with testing.

Today we have been acting on comments we got on a feature we had finished last
week. The comments asked for a couple of small changes. Or at least they seemed
small. In my head, I thought we would spend two hours at the very most to get this
out of the way then move on, but we ended up taking most of the day. Why the large
gap between estimate and actual time spent? The biggest enemy is too much optimism.
This prevents us from really questioning what could go wrong with the task and makes
us overestimate how much we know about a technology and codebase that we have only
been working on for two weeks. The fact that we are getting to grips with new
technologies and unfamiliar codebase does generally make things slower than one
would anticipate. Finally, another reason that made the mental estimate inaccurate
is the lack of analysis in making the estimate. This one was very much towards the
'gut-feeling' end of the spectrum. This spectrum goes from 'gut-feeling' (very
little cost, very little accuracy) to 'deeply analytical' (very high cost, very
high accuracy). Where you want to be on the spectrum depends on the situation,
but the 'sweet spot' will normally be somewhere between the two.
I think the takeaway from this for me is: try to be less optimistic when considering
a task and spend some time analysing what it entails and finding any areas of risk.

Testing. It turns out the 'it takes one broken window' rule does work: it
has been tempting to leave code untested because we have added it next to existing
code that is also untested. Somehow it feels OK to do this, but it is important
that we push away that feeling and start fixing those windows; or at least avoid
breaking more!
