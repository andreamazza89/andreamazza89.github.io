<p>(This post is going to be brief as I am taking a small break in Tenerife and the beach awaits us.)</p>
<p>So the course is starting on Monday, which is like WOoOoOoOoO, so exciting I wanna shout and just cannot wait! I changed the colour of my hair to celebrate this and I think it looks nice. Take a look!</p>

<p>I am writing this from vim, which is the only text editor I am now using. I have printed out a few charts with commands and try to learn how to speed typing up whenever I suspect I could be doing something faster. I talked about vim briefly <a href="https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/the-importance-of-carrying-a-compass-pre-course-wk-3/" target="_blank">here</a>. Hopefully one day I will be a mini vim-wizard and write a more in-depth post about it.</p>
<p>This week I have paired with one of my lovely peers <a href="https://github.com/vannio" target="_blank">Van</a> over the Fizzbuzz kata in Ruby. It was very nice. I love pair programming: it is so good for staying on track, learning and teaching (or rather sharing knowledge). It also makes it much harder to leave messy code behind you (not that I ever intend to do that!). Note for self is to always make sure I leave more than enough 'space' for the other person, as it is easy to just spurt out what I know, but it takes a slightly bigger effort to stop and listen. I do not think I am too bad at this but it is good to be aware of it.</p>
<p>I also got to 400 points on codewars and solved a 3Kyu challenge!</p>
<p>Finally, I started looking into TestDrivenDevelopment. In a nutshell, TDD is a (relatively) new way to approach writing code, which is part of Agile methodologies. Rather than writing a piece of code and then devising a test to check if it works, the opposite is done. That is, first a test is written, then the code to make it pass. The test defines an expectation on the code, for example one could say "the function shout is expected to return the string 'ARGH!' when called". The code is then written to satisfy the test.<br />
This has a number of advantages; using small and clear tests allows us to keep track of what is required from the program and avoid going off the rails with additional features that were not on the brief. It also helps dealing with few small problems at one time, as we work on one test at a time. A great side effect of this methodology is the fact that the suite of tests also double up as documentation on the code.<br />
I have not officially started adopting this yet, but I shall soon 'force' myself to only use TDD. It will feel backwards and slower at first, but I will stick with it and write some clean, well documented code.</p>
<p>That's it, ciao!</p>
