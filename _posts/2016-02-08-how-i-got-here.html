<p>Today I resigned. I was worried my bosses were going to be furious -we are a small/medium company and a close team- but to my relief they were very understanding and supportive.<br />
A new chapter starts; well, it does in three months, when the <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> precourse begins.</p>
<p>When I moved to the UK -about six years ago-, I had a dream: to become a sound engineer and work at Abbey Road studios. The best way to achieve that goal is doing the course I did -<a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/undergraduate/music-and-sound-recording-tonmeister">Sound Engineering (Tonmeister)</a> in Guildford- as a large proportion of the studio's staff are graduates from this course.<br />
I loved it; we learned about the physics of sound, music theory, the electronics behind microphones/speakers, recording/mixing mastering techniques. A number of exams consisted in recording/producing a band and then submitting the finished product -this was heaven! I loved it.<br />
However, with time I realised something: what I was really good at is making everything in the studio fit together and work well. I really enjoy thinking about how the whole system works and troubleshooting any issues. Another lesson I learned is that to get anywhere in this field you have to be prepared to give up all of your time and work somewhere with no windows.</p>
<p>I realised that I did not actually want what I dreamt of. That is the way with most dreams unfortunately. You spend a lot of time and effort to get there and it might turn out that you do not actually like what you fought for. Nonetheless, I would still do it all over again, it was a brilliant course, I learned a vast amount, and met some amazing people, including my partner.</p>
<p>Luckily the Tonmeister course does not only turn you into a great sound engineer, but also gives you an amazing all-round technical education. That is how I managed to get a job as Design technician at <a href="http://www.myenviron.co.uk">Environ Audio Ltd</a>. These are the guys I resigned from today, about four years after I started.<br />
Environ are a custom AudioVisual company, working in the ultra-high end of the residential market, providing Home Technology solutions from Design through to installation and commissioning. Working for Environ has been great, both for what I learned, but also the relationship with the owners, who are great people. I have had the chance to grow so rapidly, from Design technician to Design Manager, via Lighting system programmer and in the last year managing projects, both in terms of Design but also on a site level.</p>
<p>What I have not talked about so far, is how while everything above was happening, I discovered coding, and rapidly got hooked. At Uni, one of the courses included designing software to manipulate simple sound waves into complex synthesisers, using <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/">MaxMSP</a>. I spent so much time working on this, thinking about better ways to do the same thing, and adding any (useful) new features I could think of. I found great pleasure in programming. Since then, I have been doing/studying programming in my spare time.</p>
<p>A few months ago I started following <a href="https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A">this</a> great course made available for free by Stanford University. I had no tangible goal in mind, other than learning for the sake of it and because I enjoy it. It is only after a long Christmas holiday that it struck me: the first day back at work it felt very strange and I realised I want to try make programming what I do. About a month and a lot of pondering later, I am looking ahead to start at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">MakersAcademy</a> and I just cannot wait.</p>
<p>I have decided to write about this for a number of reasons, the main one being that I think the very act of writing about what and how I am learning will help engrain it in my mind. Other reasons: a nice way document and look back at my experience at Makers; get better at talking about code outside my own head; reflect on what I am learning and set goals; take a shot at winning the Makers' blog competition prize!</p>
<p>During the course, I will try to take a few minutes daily to write down what has been happening and then put it all together at the end of each week. Until then, I might be more sporadic!</p>
<p>For now, here are a few thoughts about what I hope to improve throughout the course:</p>
<p>- Talking about code.<br />
- Slowing down. I get very excited if I think I have found a solution to a problem and franctically type down code and run a test. Stop, consider all options, write elegant code and understand it.<br />
- Similar to the above. There is SO much to learn, and sometimes I jump between books/articles as I try to take in as much as I can. As I expect we will be taught at Makers, I should accept that I know very little and take one small problem at a time.</p>
<p>Finally, I have another small dream, which coding might allow me to fulfill. Work from the beach!</p>

<p>This is very close to where I am from originally in Italy. Thinking about it, I would probably get very little done and spend most time in the sea and sipping on Aperol Spritz, but I guess the idea is that the a remote job will allow me to spend some time working from home in Italy and going to the beach when I am not working! And eat some awesome fish, just like my dad in the picture below (I love fish!). I just cannot wait.</p>
