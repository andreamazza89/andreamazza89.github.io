<p style="text-align:left;"><em>&gt;--- copy/paste the usual excited comments about how great the course is here ---&lt;</em><br />
Looking back at my posts about the <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank">course</a>, I have realised I always start with how exciting and awesome this all is. I am sorry for anyone following (give us a shout if you are there!) if I sound like a broken record, but this is genuinely amazing: the community, the learning, the principles! Plus you can just skip the first paragraph and move on to the *very* interesting material below :)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Something fun happened this week: I accidentally broke my headphones while playing table tennis. I left them on the floor and literally jumped on them while playing. You can find photographic evidence at the top of the page.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Ok, breaking headphones is not that fun, I will admit, especially if you paid for them, however what was fun is that breaking them made me realise how well designed they are (they also sound pretty good and are extremely comfortable, but that's irrelevant here). If you are thinking 'how is this at all related with programming??', I will explain soon enough.<br />
What makes these headphones great (<a href="http://en-uk.sennheiser.com/on-ear-dj-headphone-hd25" target="_blank">Sennheiser HD 25-1 II</a> by the way) is their modular design, where each element is responsible for one thing only: there is a plastic headband that is responsible for holding the assembly onto one's head, the cable that connects the headphones to the source (I know, all headphones have a cable, but can you unplug it and replace with a new one?), the speaker elements in a plastic cup, and the foam pads, responsible for making the headphone comfortable (these are modular too and can be replaced). Do not take my word for it: take a look at the picture below of all the components.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="wp-image-542 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3433.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_3433" width="620" height="465" /></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now, I would like to compare the design of these headphones, which is modular, with ones that are not modular, meaning that you could not take them apart without breaking them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In my case, because my headphones are modular, I can simply throw away the head band, buy a new one and save myself a lot of money. I would have had to buy a new pair of headphones with a non-modular pair.<br />
Also, if Sennheiser come out with some fancy coloured foam pads and I want to have a different style every day, I am simply buying 7 inexpensive pads instead of a lot of non-modular headphones!<br />
Enough? How about Sennheiser themselves? They can easily reuse any of the components in any other product. For example, if they wanted to have a cheaper version of the unit with lower quality speakers, all they need is new cups as they already have the head band and cable. Awesome.<br />
Last one, I promise: how about a new manufacturer comes out and they are very good at making the speaker cup but do not have the capacity to make cables, foam pads and head bands? They can just reuse Sennheiser's parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hopefully I have convinced you that modular design is generally better than monolithic one.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now on to programming. One of the principles of good object oriented design is single responsibility. Just like my headphones, classes -the building blocks of a program in object-oriented languages- ought to be responsible for one thing only. When designing a class I try to bear in mind what each class' responsibility is. In fact, I make a little diagram with all my current classes and write down their responsibility amongst other things. When I add any new features to the program, knowing what each class is responsible for helps me decide whether the new feature can be implemented extending the existing classes or if I need new ones. The reasons and advantages of classes with single responsibility in programming are very similar to the headphones example: any class can be reused in any other program if well isolated and only responsible for one thing; also, a clear division of responsibilities normally allows a simple and easy to follow (for a human) flow of messages between instances of the classes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So this is why I was happy to have broken my headphones.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">One final thought from this week: diversity is great. Diversity means different approaches to the same problem, and different ideas to contribute to an overall stronger community. As I am pair programming with a different person every day, I have to come to really appreciate how much there is to learn from everyone around me. Seeing how different people approach the same problem is a fantastic learning tool. I really like how a program either works or not, but there are many ways to make it work, some better than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now onto weekend solo-programming :) Ciao</p>
