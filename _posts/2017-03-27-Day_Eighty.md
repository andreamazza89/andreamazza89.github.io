This weekend I once again realised how important it is to focus on one thing at a
time and have a plan.

You see, I decided to dedicate a good amount of the weekend to learning/coding,
but I was very inefficient in this. Here is why.

The number one reason is lack of focus. This is both at a microscopic and macroscopic
level (microscopic/macroscopic/microscopic/macroscopic, say these words three times and they stop making
any sense!). What I mean is I was not well concentrated during a single task and
I did too many things; or rather, I did _not_ do too many things.
Both problems are due to me wanting to do too much, that is to say, being unrealistic
on what I can achieve. So, rather than spending say two hours coding/learning and another
two watching a movie, I did four hours of non-productive coding while not really
watching the movie. Similarly, rather than working on a couple of things and reading
a bit of a book, I opened a million tabs on my browser and 'got started' on several
projects/tutorials/etc. This is me getting excited about how much there is to learn and do, which
is a good thing, but it should be regulated by pragmatism: I need to be realistic
about how much I can achieve in one weekend, make a plan, and execute it with focus.

I thing having a plan is key here: that way you can be realistic about how much
time you will spend coding/learning and figuring out how much you can achieve in
that time. This also lets you look back at what you have done and see how much you
did actually achieve.

Uh, and don't forget to pomodoro it all!!
