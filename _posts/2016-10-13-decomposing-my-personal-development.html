<p>Ready for some cool news? I have a job!!</p>
<p>Yes, I will be writing code in exchange of money. Awesome. I will be joining <a href="http://www.deloittedigital.com/eu/" target="_blank">Deloitte Digital</a> as a junior developer, although I will not be starting for a couple of months.</p>
<p>In this time, I want to to keep growing as a developer everyday, but the prospect of doing this on my own is a bit overwhelming: how do I know what things I should be doing, what books to read; who is going to give me feedback on what I am doing?</p>
<p>There is a concept in software engineering that I am very fond of, that of decomposition. In short, decomposition means taking a large problem and breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, to replace a one big problem with a few small (and easy to solve) problems. I used to do this at University, when I had to write essays. I really disliked writing essays, so to help me in the process, I would first break down the essay into big sections, then subsections of those, and further subsections and so on, until I was left with tiny bits of essay to write. I traded the scary empty page and blinking cursor with a few short 'forms' to fill. A nice side-effect of decomposing a problem into smaller components is that you can track your progress and clearly see how much you have done so far.</p>
<p>So, in order not to feel too overwhelmed and to be more effective/accountable in this period, I have decided to make a plan for my personal development. I have made it public, so anyone can take a look and comment; here it is:Â <a href="http://bit.ly/2evxtlM" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2evxtlM</a>.</p>
<p>I will be using the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">pomodoro technique</a>, deciding roughly how long I will be working each day and on what. As there is SO much I could learn, I need to make sure I stay effective and focused on a few things.</p>
<p>That's it, please hit me with comments/feedback if you have any :)</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
