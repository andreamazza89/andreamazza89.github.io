### Pills
- The importance of consistency in domain language.
- Getting started on the chat server.

As I finished working on my contact manager app in java, one of the things I have
learned is how important it is to maintain a consistent domain language. This should
both be respected and enforced by the developer: making sure we refer to business
domain ideas clearly and unambiguously is as important as ensuring that everyone
involved in the process does so too.
I have realised that my codebase, as small as it is, has already developed some
naming inconsistencies: _editing_ a contact is the same as _updating_ it (or is
it?!?); the same goes for _adding_ and _saving_. Much like good names for Classes,
variables, Modules and methods make a codebase easier to understand, consistency
in naming ensures future developers do not get thrown by similar names for the
same thing: if it is the same thing, then it should be called the same.

Tomorrow I will start working on a chat server (written in java), which is exciting!
This will get me to look into java sockets and multi threading. Nice.
