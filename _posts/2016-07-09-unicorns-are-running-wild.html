<p>This week at makers was great.</p>
<p>We were divided into teams of four people and asked to work on a project with minimal guidance.<br />
I am super happy about the team (ours was team unicorns) dynamics and proud of what we built, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/vannio/unicorn-framework" target="_blank">here</a> and is available as a Node package, just install Node and type <strong><em>npm install unicorn-list</em></strong> in the root of your project directory. As I write this post, one day ahead of publishing the framework it has been downloaded 120 times, whaat??!</p>
<p>The brief was to make a simple front-end app, which displays lists dynamically, based on a to-do list model. You can add items to the to-do list and then check a box next to the task to move them to the 'completed' pile. The really cool thing is that after doing this simple app, we were supposed to create a framework out of it, to make building a simple web app with dynamic lists uber-simple.<br />
What was awesome about our team is that we built everything from scratch, without using any other frameworks/libraries, starting from a static server in Node, whose only task is to read files from memory and send a copy to the client upon request. The server looks at the request url and determines which file should be read into a variable then sent as a response.<br />
We then went on to design and write a (very basic but awesome) templating engine. The engine takes a <strong><em>.cats</em></strong> file and renders any dynamic content based on conventions we established. See below an example <em><strong>.cats</strong></em> file, which is effectively the html template of your one-page app and contains some special syntax that the templating engine picks up and renders based on a javascript object that contains arrays of strings.</p>

Finally, we put together the whole thing as a Node package, which allows anyone to download the framework and get started in a few seconds. We wrote a shell script that moves all files into place and also prints a pretty unicorn once the installation is complete!<br />
This week I also gave a talk to our 'juniors' (people who just started the course) on the benefits of using diagrams, as well as single class responsibility and how to diagram classes' interaction; it was well received and I am happy I can start giving back to the community as I have already taken so much from it!<br />
I have uploaded the slideshow <a href="https://github.com/andreamazza89/diagramming_presentation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
