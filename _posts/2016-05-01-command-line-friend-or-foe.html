<p>Pre-course week is coming to an end. I am still working at my soon-to-be previous job, so this week has been pretty intense, waking up early to study before work, and then rushing home (well, after one mandatory game of table tennis) to study into the night. It might be tiring, but I am loving it! Learning the Makers way is great: they tell you where you need to get to, give you tools to get there, but you are doing the walking and figuring out (slightly obscure methaphor, hopefully makes sense).</p>
<p>This week I have also discovered the marvellous world of typing; yes, typing. It sounds silly, but I have never formally learnt to type on a keyboard, which means I am not a very fast typer. There is this little fun <a href="http://play.typeracer.com/" target="_blank">website</a> where you can race, either solo or socially and my top speed is just over 50 words per minute, which is not at all impressive. I am re-learning to type using <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/" target="_blank">this website</a>, which makes for a fun break! On the subject of typing, I am also learning vim, which is a terminal text editor worth having under your belt. In fact, I am typing the draft for this post using it!</p>
<p>The focus of this week has been command line and Git. I am only going to talk about the former.</p>
<p>In general, command line describes one way in which the user interacts with the machine. When using command line, there are no graphics, only lines of text, one after the other. Each line is either the computer 'talking' to the user, or vice-versa. For instance, the computer might say something like: "I am currently looking at the Downloads folder and am ready for commands." And the user might say: "Add a folder called Pictures and move all my pictures into it". Cool no? Another way the user can interact with the computer is using a graphical interface, which is the most common way (the one we all know), as it is easier to pick up and looks nicer (not as cool though!).</p>
<p>Now for a bit more jargon. Both the command line and graphical interfaces can be referred to as "shell". The name is not accidental: the core level of computer operations is called "Kernel" and is very difficult for a human to 'talk' in Kernel language. So the shell is wrapped around the Kernel and allows us, the human, to talk to the Kernel and get it to do things for us. The shell is really just a translator. Staying on the methaphor, there are different languages we may speak (i.e. command-line or graphical user interface), and different translators to translate each language into Kernel language. The most used command-line dialect (sorry, I really like methaphors, and there is more than one command-line language!) is called <em>Bash</em>, which is what we have been learning this week. I made a little drawing to exemplify the human-shell-kernel concept.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-376 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3316.jpg" alt="IMG_3316" width="3264" height="2448" /></p>
<p>The command line used to be the only way we could interact with computers, however, fast forward a few decades and there are some pretty attractive alternatives, namely the various graphical user interfaces we are used to, be it the latest Window or OSX.</p>
<p>The question is: why do we use command line? Is it better? Is it worse? I think the answer is - it depends.</p>
<p>For the average user, the graphical interface is incredibly easy to pick up , intuitive and requires very little knowledge of its 'language': we know we can move the pointer to a file, double click on it to open it, or drag and drop it on a different folder, or right click for more options, etc.<br />
On the other side, we have the command line, which requires the user to learn the various arcane commands like 'cp' or 'rm' or 'cd' to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>So far not so good for command-line. Why go through the pain of learning all the syntax? A world of programmer-perks awaits. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster processing speed. This might seem useless if you think about copy/pasting one file, but when dealing with vast amounts of files to process, a shell that has no graphics to worry about is a faster shell.</li>
<li>No mouse, faster human. Although it takes learning the syntax and being a quick typer, having hands stuck to the keyboard and not having to touch the mouse speeds thing up.</li>
<li>Fewer steps to achieve the same thing. This can be explained with an example: suppose we want to move a file "TEST.TXT" into its parent folder.Here are the steps required in command line:<br />
a) type <code>mv TEST.TXT ..</code><br />
And these using a graphical user interface (one of the ways it could be done):<br />
a) right-click on the file, press 'cut'<br />
b) navigate to the parent folder<br />
c) right-click somewhere in the folder, find a bit of empty space, right-click and press 'paste'</li>
<li>A command-line environment like Bash also allows you to use scripts to automate processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are numerous other advantages as well as disadvantages, but I am going to stop here. The main point is that all these advantages are good for programmers but useless for non-programmers (or at least the gains are not worth the effort), which is why programmers still use command-line and others do not!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
