### Pills
- Working on a kata performance.

As part of my current iteration, I was tasked with preparing a kata (read 'coding
exercise' if you do not know what that means) to perform in front of a number of
crafters to get feedback. I was asked to focus on performing the kata as fast as
possible, which makes this more about workflow, fast typing and shortcuts than
the solution itself.

I was told I should take under 10 minutes; I chose to do the word-wrap kata:
given a text input with no line breaks, add line breaks for the given column
length without breaking words if possible. In my first run I took just under two
hours...Not quite 10 minutes! However this was the first time I attempted it, so
I was figuring out a solution, but once I have a solution in place, I can simply
memorise it as the point is to go as fast as possible and figuring things out
is not part of this exercise.

One reason why I took so long is because figuring out how to use the collect
function in Java (the equivalent of a reduce with a custom accumulator) was hard.
However, one important thing to learn is that I should avoid the 'big leap'; this
is when you start writing simple tests and simple code and evolve your solution
in small steps to cover more cases, but it eventually gets to a point where passing
the next test requires a huge step and maybe throwing away what you have done so
far. This happened to me, and, instead of reconsidering the test I had written,
I just took the big leap, which is error prone and takes longer. It turns out that
a simpler test did exist, which would lead me to a more even distribution of steps
and no big leap; I shall try that today!
