Here's an exciting announcement: I have a new job, which starts on Monday!!

I will be joining [8thLight](http://www.8thLight.com) as a resident apprentice. Here are
a few reasons why this is great:

- As a resident apprentice, my first 5/6 months will be devoted to learning, so I
can keep growing and eventually (if successful) call myself a software Crafter.
- The company ethos is fundametally based on software craftmaship [principles](https://8thlight.com/principles/).
- Part of the above principles is a strong emphasis on continual learning: everyone
in the company is eager to keep learning and improving, no matter how experienced.
- Every Friday afternoon is devoted to learning, so everyone is free to 
read/research/pair_program, etc, and workshops/talk are often held.
- One of the co-founders is Uncle Bob's son, and Uncle Bob himself has a number 
of posts in the company blog!
- Most mornings, the office gathers for a 20-30 minutes presentation on a topic 
presented by one of the staff.

As part of the apprenticeship, I will be asked to keep a diary. I have now migrated
my previous blog to here, where I will keep adding new posts on the apprenticeship.

Quite excited to start!

Ciao
