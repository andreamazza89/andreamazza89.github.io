New iteration, new language: I have now started to learn Clojure, which I was
looking forward to!

I like the simplicity of the syntax. The main construct looks like _(operator 
operand ... operand)_, for example `(+ 40 2)` evaluates to `42`.

The biggest challenge for me as a beginner is to get acquainted with the way Clojure
code looks. Let me explain; with all the other languages I have been using so far,
when I first look at the code, without trying to read into it, my brain tries to
scan and analyse the contents as it recognises 'shapes': the shape of a class, that
of a method, etc.. As I am going through these 'shapes', I make a mental map of
what I am looking at, sort of a table of contents. This way I get a quick initial
overview of what I am dealing with. I can then go into more depth if I want to.
Now, these 'shapes' look different in Clojure, so at them moment when I first
glance at code I see this:

```
       asdf;løøøøølhgabeff
asdadglh
qdg
               eø∫ø¨√dponpoanga
adsg;ajsbdgpoqbdpgqoubpqeofbg
             ¨¥ç    ø^©

π ø∫∂ø∑^∫ƒº  gjkhaskdgjhasg
aghø∫∂˙∂©∑… qiwughiqwuegh+++  + +
ajgbqkjrbgkjqbgkjb

asdlgkjlkjen                 π
```

I know that the 'shapes' are there but my brain does not recognise them yet, so
it takes me longer to decipher the code. I am sure this will go away soon, as I
keep reading more and more Clojure.
