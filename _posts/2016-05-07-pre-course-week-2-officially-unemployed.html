<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thursday was my last day of work at <a href="http://www.myenviron.co.uk/" target="_blank">Environ</a>, which included a fantastic sendoff and even a few tears. Thank you Dan and Ben.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Week two of the pre-course is also coming to an end and I am loving it so much: I am excited with how much and what we are learning and how much more there is to learn (although it is important I learn one thing at a time, as I promised I would <a href="https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/learning-to-slow-down/" target="_blank">here!</a>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week we have moved on to Ruby and have had a few challenges to solve simple problems in Ruby. We are also to amass as many points as we can on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">codewars</a>, which is awesome! Even though I have spent most of my 2 months coming up to the course studying the language and playing on codewars, there is still so much for me to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some pair programming, both remote and in-person, happened. Pair programming is simply the process of tackling a problem as a pair: one person is 'driving' i.e. they hold the keyboard and actually do the typing, whereas the other person is 'navigating', discussing how the problem is being approached, checking for any mistakes and providing a different perspective; every so often (I think 25 minutes seems to be the norm) the roles are swapped. The amazing thing about this is the sharing of knowledge; both the people and the code benefit from this process. I am a big fan of the idea that we can all help each other by sharing knowledge and benefit from the process as a society rather than protecting what we know and our ideas from others. This is very similar to how open source works. Very nice no?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ok, final thought: I really like pseudo-coding. It consists in taking my hands away from the laptop and thinking about a problem from a macroscopic point of view, without getting caught up in the small picture/s. As a novel programmer what often happens is that you are given a problem and start forcing the few things you know into a solution, without really knowing where your code is headed. With pseudocoding, you think about the bigger picture and sketch it on a piece of paper, without worrying about the details; this creates a framework for you to then start coding. I am trying to develop my own standard of symbols to pseudocode; for instance, the picture below shows a loop with some conditional logic in it. (Please ignore the actual content).</span></p>
<p class="p1">That's it, ciao.</p>
