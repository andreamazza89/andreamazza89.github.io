<p>It has finally happened. Out of nowhere, while working on the solution to a problem on <a href="http://www.codewars.com">codewars</a>, I just did it, I used recursion! It was magic.<br />
Recursion is something I had known for a while but always figured I should leave it as something to learn later as it is a fairly advanced topic for someone who has just started.</p>
<p>In computer science, recursion is a process whereby a function invokes itself.<br />
Here is a simple example:</p>
<p>[f(x) = x + f(x + 1)]</p>
<p>Well, although simple, the above is useless, as it creates an infinite loop and never yields a result. Try to substitute x with any number and work out the result to see how the function keeps calling on itself, forever!</p>
<p>So what is the point with recursion? The trick is in defining a function the eventually reaches a stop.</p>
<p>Building on the example above, we could arbitrarily impose that the function will return 0 if x is larger than say 3. Let us try and work out the result for x = 0 then.</p>
<p>First the new definition: [f(x) = x + f(x + 1)], return 0 if x &gt; 3</p>
<p>f(0) = 0 + f(1)<br />
f(1) = 1 + f(2)<br />
f(2) = 2 + f(3)<br />
f(3) = 3 + f(4)<br />
f(4) = 0, since (x &gt; 3)</p>
<p>Building backwards, f(3) is 3, so f(2) is 5 and f(1) is 6, giving us f(0) = 6.</p>
<p>Recursion -when possible- offers a much more elegant solution to its non-recursive counterpart (at least I think, as I am not an expert!). Recursion is a little magic, as it allows an infinite process to be generated from a finite statement. For it to be useful in computing, the infinite process has to stop at some point, but still, pretty neat, no?</p>
<p>Ok, in other news, I am quite excited about the <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">MakersAcademy</a> precourse for my cohort starting in 2 weeks! I have also met with one of the people in my cohort, which was nice and check out this cool project of hers: she made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3zc5qh/i_built_a_smart_mirror_for_my_vanity/">smart mirror</a>!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
