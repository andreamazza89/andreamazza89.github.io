<p>Hi.</p>
<p>This week was the first week post Makers and I am really enjoying it, with a good mixture of job hunting, studying, working on tech tests and attending meetups.</p>
<p>Went to Edinburgh for the Fringe over the weekend with Liz and our flatmates. Highlights: lots of laughs, fried haggis and a lovely walk on top of a hill, check out a picture of the view!</p>

OK so I am starting to look into functional programming and I would like to talk about it. I do not know much about it so please do not use this as a reference and do not hate me if I say any travesties. In fact, please do let me know in the comments if there is anything I should rectify, or do get in touch to discuss :)</p>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm. The expression 'programming paradigm' describes the 'style' of programming. This is a bit vague (sorry), but effectively depicts the main features of a programming style, which can span over a number of concerns. Here is a -hopefully- good analogy: think of programming paradigms as music genres. A music genre summarises transversal features that songs of the same genre share; for example, dance music is often fast and makes heavy use of digital instruments. Much like music genres, the features described in programming paradigms are not always concerned with the same areas of concern; in the analogy, some genres describe a particular rhythm, others the way a singer sings, others the instruments used, etc.</p>
<p>One of the -currently- most popular paradigms is Object Oriented, and is the one we were taught at Makers. In Object Oriented programming all (or most, depending on the language) data is described as an Object. An Object groups together (encapsulates) behaviour and state that belongs to a certain abstraction. Here is an example: let's invent an Object, Person.<br />
Now give this Object some behaviour; let's say a person can #grow, #eat, #sleep, #greet, #fight and #die.<br />
Do not forget to give this Object some state too; something like @age, @hunger, @tiredness and @health.<br />
Now we can generate a number of Person objects, and they will each have their own state (how old they are, how hungry they are..) and be able to interact with each other and the world around them. This is pretty cool.<br />
However there is something in this story that could cause a lot of pain. That is state.<br />
The problem with state is that it can get very complex very soon and generate unexpected results, also called side effects. Here is an example: if we use the #grow behaviour on a person, this will increase the @age state, which is what we expected, however after a certain age growing older might also decrease your health, which is a side effect.</p>
<p>Side effects make our programs harder to test and unpredictable. What if we could do away with state?</p>
<p>Enter Functional Programming. It is not that state does not exist; it does exist, but is immutable (cannot be altered). Functional Programming is all about functions as opposed to objects (as it says on the tin). Functions are used to transform data to into the desired result. A very important concept in functional programming is that of pure functions. The output of a pure function is always the same for a given input. A pure function has no side effects. Awesome, so we can trust a certain pure function to always behave in the same way (no mutable state exists to alter the result) and only do the one thing it promises to do. This keeps Uncle Bob very happy.</p>
<p>Cool stuff right?</p>
<p>I will be posting more on this as I find out more and reflect on it. Next time I should include some code examples too!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
