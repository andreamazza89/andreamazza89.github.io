<p>The precourse has finally started; I am still at work for another week but after than I will be fully dedicated to this.</p>
<p>Last night was the launch event, where I got to meet the peeps on my cohort, although I feel like I only scraped the surface as there are 40 of us!!</p>
<p>Anyway, I have just done a fresh reinstall of OSX and am ready to get my head stuck into all there is for us to learn (which is endless!).</p>
<p>As I read through the 'table of contents' of what we are to get through I am  getting more and more excited, there is so much and I love this, and I am opening new windows, starting a youtube Video of a lecture here, reading a bit of a Wiki page there...I need to slow down.</p>
<p>And this is what this post is about: I need to make a serious commitment towards focusing on learning one thing at a time, step by step, or else I will only be jumping between topics like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k85mRPqvMbE" target="_blank">crazy frog</a> (sorry about that). There is just so much for us to take in, yet the best way to go about it is to take it easy and let everything settle in, so here it goes:</p>
<p><em>I promise I will do my best to focus on one thing at a time, favouring deeper and solid knowledge of fewer concepts over marginal, mnemonic  understanding of more. Should I be distracted by new topics whilst focusing on one, I shall keep a note of what that is and go back to it later.</em></p>
<p>There it is, now I have written it down I will look like a fool if I do not go by it!</p>
