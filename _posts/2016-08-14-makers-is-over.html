<p>This week was the 16th and final week at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a> - sigh.<br />
It has been an amazing ride and as of Friday we have all been released into the real world to find a job as junior developers!</p>
<p>This weekend Liz and I went to Brixham in South Devon, which was very nice, check out a picture below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_3533.jpg" alt="IMG_3533.JPG" width="3264" height="2448" /></p>
<p>It was slightly strange not to be coding all the time, but it was super nice, and getting back to a good work/life balance is important too.</p>
<p>The course has gone lighting-fast, and I have learned so much in the past four months; the biggest thing I have learned is how to learn something new in a limited amount of time. And there is still so, SO much to learn, I cannot wait.</p>
<p>Finding a job in a completely new industry is slightly scary but also very exciting.</p>
<p>So, what does the future look like?</p>
<p>As of tomorrow I will be in full job-hunting mode, spending (I think) 25% of my days researching companies/applying for jobs and the rest to carry on learning, which should be so much fun!</p>
<p>I am not in a massive rush to jump into a job and I want to make sure I find the right company for me. At the moment my main criteria are a place where I can learn the most, grow as a developer and write clean code, following Agile/XP practices. I want to be a software crafter.</p>
<p>Two things I am excited about for the near future: <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/" target="_blank">Upcase</a> challenge and setting up a programming book club.</p>
<p>Upcase is a learning platform run by a fantastic software firm, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a> (would be nice to work there), and we get a free month of it as Makers Alumni. The challenge is to go through all the material in one month. I am not sure if itÂ is possible, plus I might struggle to keep it up as I am going to be on Holiday for 10 days in a couple of weeks, but I can take a bit longer than a month and still have learned heaps!</p>
<p>Regarding the book club, there is a book, <a href="http://www.poodr.com/" target="_blank">POODR</a> (sorry for the acromym) by Sandi Metz, which is one of the many 'bibles' a programmer should read and refer to. I have already read it but want to go through it again to grasp the concepts better. I think it would be fun to arrange Meetups to gather with other people and discuss concepts from the book plus have a little practice on them. I will look for a sponsor and see if I can arrange it at Makers.</p>
<p>If you were worried and sad thinking I might stop posting articles, worry not! I am going to carry on writing, as it is quite nice to either retrospect or go through an interesting concept or both!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
