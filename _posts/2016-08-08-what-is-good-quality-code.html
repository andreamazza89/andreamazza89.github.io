<p>Hi :)</p>
<p>As part of  applying for a position at a software consultancy, I have been asked to answer a few questions, including what I think 'good quality' is in code.</p>
<p>How nice of them to ask! Seriously, this makes me want to work for them even more, but also it is a super interesting topic, as there is no simple and indisputable answer. Much like I love the fact that you can write software that does the 'thing' it is expected to do (this is binary: it either works or it does not) and then you can write software that does that same thing but is <em>well</em> written (and what well means here is far from binary).</p>
<p>Anyway, enough with the introductions; here is my answer to the question. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts and imagine my position might evolve as I grow in my career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you determine if software is "high quality”?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please notice that the values below are general indicators of ‘high quality’ in software rather than axioms. Quality in software is not a binary attribute and is a debatable subject, which makes it even more fun.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Interestingly, some of the values below apply to good design in general, not just coding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simplicity_A simple solution to a problem might not be easy to find, but tends to be the best. Simple solutions are easy to reason about and modify/extend if necessary. Spending extra time upfront finding the most simple solution saves significant time down the line when a new feature can be easily implemented thanks to a simple design.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human-readability_The only reason software exists is because someone needs it to perform a certain function, be that for business, entertainment, health, etc. As people’s needs are always changing, software also needs to change and adapt. The most easy the code is to read, the easier it will be for the future programmers to implement new features. Simple code is key to human-readability; good naming of variables, classes, methods, etc. also has a significant impact on this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modularity_This is equivalent to the principle of single responsibility in object-oriented design; good software tends to be modular, whereby each part has a well-defined function that allows easy reuse, replacement and/or extensibility. I recently wrote a blog post about this (<a href="http://bit.ly/1tvyBZJ"><span class="s2">http://bit.ly/1tvyBZJ</span></a>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ease of change_This goes in hand with modularity and readability: high quality software tends to require the least changes to implement a new feature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Squint-test_This is more of a positive side-effect from the above than anything else. Credits to Sandi Metz for this idea. ‘High quality’ software looks good and neat, even without reading the contents. A page full of good code will look nice and regular when squinting at it.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having written this a couple of weeks ago, I would like to add the following point:</p>
<p>Principle of least surprise_Code should be very unsurprising, which ties in with all the values above. If the code is of good quality, any developer (of the appropriate skill level) should be able to approach a code base without being surprised and simply read through the application without scratching their head. I appreciate this point is very similar to the first one, but is worth stressing again. There is an interesting description of this in Sandro  Mancuso's book 'The Software Craftsman' where he tells about one of his first experiences in a large software company and his lead developer being annoyed at him for having used an arcane solution to a problem that most developers would find difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
