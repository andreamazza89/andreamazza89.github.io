<p>Another week has gone and <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a> does not stop being an awesome ride. We are now a third of the way through, looking forward to the rest of it and learning Javascript next week.</p>
<p>As of last week I have started going to quite a few tech meetups. Meetups are free events that feature a talk, workshop, hands-on session, or a mixture of the three. They are normally packed with very interesting people and most of them provide free pizza and beers (say what?!). I think it is virtually impossible to go to any meetup and it be a waste of your time: if all else fails, you get free dinner. One step up, you get free dinner and meet interesting people. Two steps up, you learn something, meet people and have free dinner! This is unreal!!<br />
What I love about meetups is that whoever organises them has no hidden agenda, they are not trying to sell you anything (at least not so far); their only interest is to contribute to the community by sharing knowledge gratuitously.<br />
The meetup I enjoyed most this week was a hands-on one, organised by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/" target="_blank">London Software Craftmanship Community</a>. The event (a regular one, on Wednesdays) consists in a few people meeting up and coding together in pairs. I knew I was going to be the n00b in the room, but I am ok with that. The person I paired with was great and extremely kind and patient to teach me about functional programming. We paired over a kata (a short programming exercise) in Erlang and I was really excited to learn a bit about a new language and a bit about a fairly different programming paradigm from the one I am used to (Object-oriented). Also, I am extremely grateful to the person I paired with, as he took the time to explain concepts that are extremely basic for him. Again, lovely people in this community, who are happy to give up some of their time to help others out.</p>
<p>Back to <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a>, this week we have completed the web-architecture circle, with databases. These might seem trivial from the surface, but it turns out there is so much to take in, especially when put in context within the full stack. At some points this week I felt overwhelmed by how much there is to learn and worried about how fast I am learning and how many things I am learning about...Well it is time to remind myself about relaxing and learning one thing at a time, like I promised <a href="https://andreacodesblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/learning-to-slow-down/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is ok to feel like there is so much I do not know; in fact, I do not think I will ever feel like I know enough (hello Socrates!), which is one of my drives for continual learning. It is also a good idea to look back and marvel at how much I have learned since joining <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a>.</p>
<p>With so much to learn ahead of me, what if I could take in more information in a given period? I have recently heard about speed reading and am going to try learn to speed read. The idea is that instead of vocalising each word in our mind as we do with our voice, we take in a lot more information and increase reading time, whilst -allegedly- retaining the same level of comprehension. Sounds brilliant, but I remain skeptic until I see it work.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
