<p>Well, that is seriously exciting!!</p>
<p>The last three months have been flying and I just cannot wait to get started with the pre-course at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" target="_blank">Makers</a>. In a week I will be waving <a href="http://www.myenviron.co.uk" target="_blank">Environ</a> goodbye and thanking them for all they have given and taught me in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>I am taking a break from coding this weekend and spend time with Lizzie (my girlfriend) as this is one out of two free weekends I get for the next three months. The rest of the time I will be learning (unless I am sleeping or eating!).</p>
<p>Anyway, this morning I published my first Kata on <a href="http://www.myenviron.co.uk" target="_blank">codewars</a>! Codewars is a very addictive website where users can add coding challenges (called 'Katas') for others to solve. The challenges are ranked and the more you solve the more points you get. After a couple of months of just 'using' the service I am finally giving back.</p>
<p>Anyway, my challenge is currently in Beta status, waiting for the community to have a look and -hopefully- approve it. You can find it<a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-biggest-piece-of-gold" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
<p>I am not very happy with my own solution to my own challenge and I am not sure if there is a smarter and more elegant way to do it, which is a little embarrassing, but hopefully I will start getting feedback from the community soon and see where I stand.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
